ABOUT
I'm a Northwestern University PhD candidate, disaster analyst, and data visualization enthusiast who works with data to inform decisions after an event. In my research, the communities that I organize, or with the students I advise, I value cultivating open and understanding environments to bring different perspectives together. I've been fortunate enough to learn how to actualize some of my values from my two advisors: Professors Jack Baker at Stanford and David Lallemant at the Earth Observatory of Singapore.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

MODELING POST-DISASTER IMPACT WITH DATA
I develop flexible, statistical models to quantify a disaster's impact to inform early recovery decisions after an event. 
My research focuses on three main tenants, which are especially important as we enter this data-driven age in disaster management. 
Usable outputs. I have a specific and realistic decision and end-user in mind when developing a model (in this case, those policymakers creating recovery plans in regions with little surveyed data).
Flexible models with limits. Disasters are very place-based. Furthermore, statistical models developed in one place are not expected to perform as well if ported over to an entirely different place. I develop frameworks for models to be implemented in specific locations and try my best to be clear about the limits of these models.
Thoughtful metrics. The choice of metric is important not just from a usability point of view (i.e. can it be used to make a decision) but also determines what type of plans are put in place. Metrics that predicate disaster aid shape how well (or not well) different groups recover. For examples, see my blog post or this code switch episode.
